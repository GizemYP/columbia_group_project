# Overview

Part I - 

Part II - for this part of the project we looked at all baby names from SSN data for 2012 and 2016 Election years to determine top 10 by gender and political affiliation.  The outcome was illustrated via US Map (coded with GeoPandas).  Further we compared top 10 choices by gender for commonalities and variances and displayed the oucome in combined DF's by gender and year.  Lastly we show origin and meaning of the top names via DF based on the internet search for the content.

Part III -
