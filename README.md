# Overview

Part I - for this part we looked at the popular names in male and female categories and throughout the decades. Dataframes created using the API data from Kaggle. Biggest discovery in this section was the limited diversity in male names. In the top 30 names in the US in the last 11 decades, only 3 of them were female names. This indicates the reprtitive nature of the male names possibly due to tradition of passing names from father to son. (For Data see: Part-1 and Part-1_insights files)

Part II - for this part of the project we looked at all baby names from SSN data for 2012 and 2016 Election years to determine top 10 by gender and political affiliation.  The outcome was illustrated via US Map (coded with GeoPandas).  Further we compared top 10 choices by gender for commonalities and variances and displayed the oucome in combined DF's by gender and year.  Lastly we show origin and meaning of the top names via DF based on the internet search for the content.
